4. Open the 'MQL5' folder.
5. Open the 'Indicators' folder.
6. Copy the downloaded indicator file into the 'Indicators' folder.
7. Restart your MetaTrader 5 platform.

## Usage

Once the Chart Symbols Synchronizer indicator is installed, it will automatically synchronize trading symbols on all other charts within the same terminal. This ensures that the same symbols are displayed on all your charts, making it easier to analyze and trade the markets.

The indicator will check for any new symbols added or if the synchronization button is clicked. If either of these events occur, the indicator will synchronize the symbols on all other charts within the same terminal.

## How it Works

The Chart Symbols Synchronizer indicator is written in MQL5 and utilizes the MetaTrader 5 platform's built-in functions and features. It has two main functions: `OnInit()` and `OnCalculate()`.

In the `OnInit()` function, the indicator is attached to the chart using the `ChartIndicatorAdd()` function. This ensures that the indicator is active and running on the chart.

In the `OnCalculate()` function, the indicator performs its main calculations. It first checks if a new symbol is added or if the synchronization button is clicked. If either of these events occur, the `SynchronizeSymbols()` function is called to synchronize the symbols on all other charts within the same terminal.

The `IsNewSymbolAdded()` and `IsButtonClicked()` functions are used to check if a new symbol is added or if the button is clicked, respectively. You can customize these functions to add your own logic for checking these events.

The `SynchronizeSymbols()` function is responsible for synchronizing the symbols on all other charts within the same terminal. You can customize this function to implement your own logic for synchronizing symbols.
